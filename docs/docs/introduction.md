# Introduction

This library provides a simple string language which in the end returns only a string, thus why "String Language" 
name - it exists purely because concatenating strings with other similar libraries seemed overkill and not easy to read.

Library includes a string tokenizer along with a token runner, so you can run your strings later on - most importantly of all,
it includes a Serializer so you can store those tokenized strings somewhere (which you would want probably).

Features include string concatenated with methods (all of which are stored within a string).

:::info[Good to know]

Methods will be later referenced to as __expressions__ in this documentation.
